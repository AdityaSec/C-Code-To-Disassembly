# C-Code-To-Disassembly

Hi Reader

I have been working on something as side project. I plan to make content specifically for learning Assembly, Reversing, Windows Internals and last but not the least Malware analysis. Didnt covered everything, but major things related to Malware analysis are covered.

Here is the second part of it: C Code Disassembly.
